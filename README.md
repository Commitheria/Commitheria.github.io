# Commitheria 
## History 
Commitheria is a non-profit organization project, created by [MAT services](https://mat-services.github.io) on June 25, 2025. 
## Purpose 
Commitheria is an open organization aimed at providing tools, popular or not, managed by volunteers in order to avoid all types of content that could be bothersome for users. 
## Principle 
### Users For the users of Commitheria, the services provided by Commitheria should be the most conducive to work or personal use. (No NSFW.) 
### Participants
